## Documentation of Project 1 - SQL

### This repository contains data from my first project that I did during the WBS Coding School Data Science Bootcamp from 18th October 2021 to 11th February 2022


Contents of the repository:

* Publications - Contains SQL scripts with basic queries on the database *publications* and the database dump itself
* Magist - Contains an SQL script with queries on the database *magist* and the database dump itself

### Publications

I did two SQL challenges with questions about the *publications* database. The SQL scripts contain the tasks and the queries I wrote to get the answers.

### Magist

This *magist* database originally comes from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce). I had the opportunity to explore the database and prepare a presentation in 2 1/2 days. 

For this task I was a Data Analyst at the big spanish company *Eniac* that sells Apple products and Apple compatible accessories and sets great value for super friendly customer support. From this point of view I had two main questions to answer.

* Does *magist* serve as a good marketplace for high-end tech products?
* Can our company rely on a fast delivery of orders through magist?

The SQL script contains more questions as basis for a deeper analysis of the *magist* dataset. 

#### Some key findings

* *magist* is a samll platform that sells only few tech products and even less high end tech products
* average price for tech products is around 130â‚¬
* brasilian economy probably not strong enough for high end tech products like Eniac is selling
* *magist* has only 15000 tech product customers, that is around only 15% of all customers
* delivery is slow, but maybe normal in Brasil
* however, customers complain about slow delivery
